# Bundas Store Sales Prediction 

#### This repository contains a series of notebooks with which we try to predict the leading factors that influence the number of sales that a store will recieve.

### [Problem Statement](STRATHMOREDATATHONCHALLENGE.pdf)

- Bundas is a supermarket that has stores all over the country and has collected sales data for over 1000 products across its stores. You have been hired as a data scientist to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

- They plan on using this model to understand the properties of products and stores that play a paramount role in increasing sales.

### [1st Notebook (Exploratory Analysis)]([Notebook1]Explanatory_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

- After analysing our dataset, we find that only 1.1% of the Item_IDs are repeated in the dataset which means that 98.9% of the items for sale in these stores are unique.
